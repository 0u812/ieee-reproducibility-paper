% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex




% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/



% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.

\usepackage{hyperref}
\newcommand{\email}[1]{\href{mailto:#1}{#1}}


% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Dynamical modeling has made great strides with the creation of a whole-cell model of \textit{Mycoplasma genitalium}.
However, this rapid advancement also creates new challenges. Here, we focus on model reproducibility, the role it
plays in the \textit{Mycoplasma} model, and how the major challenges can be addressed.
We examine how the issue of reproducibility in the context of concurrency has been addressed
in computer science and discuss how these technologies can be applied to dynamical modeling.
Finally, we mention areas which can accelerate the construction of accurate whole-cell models.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{R}{eproducibility} is one of the central tenets of the scientific method.
\textit{Reproducibility} is the ability to confirm a result via a completely independent test, including different investigators, experimental methods, and experimental machinery. 
This rigorous standard eliminates conclusions that were based on incorrect methods, machinery, or experiments and ensures that scientific results are only accepted as facts once multiple scientists and tests have thoroughly dismissed other potential explanations. 

\textit{Replicability}, the ability to reproduce a result given the same experimental machinery and conditions, is a related concept. 
Replicability is a more liberal standard than reproducibility because replicability does not require independent experimental methods or equipment.
Consequently, replicability only has the power to eliminate conclusions that were based on erroneous experiments, and cannot eliminate conclusions based on faulty methods or machinery.

Due to the complexity of modern scientific experiments and financial, time, and publishing pressures, investigators often do not have the time or resources to design orthogonal methods to reproduce results independently. Instead, investigators frequently replicate reported results using use the published method. This decreased emphasis on independently reproducing results has the potential to allow us to accept false results based on faulty methods.

Computational biology has become more replicable over the past several years through the introduction of standards including CellML \cite{cuellar2003overview}, SBML \cite{hucka2003}, SED-ML \cite{sedml2011}, the COMBINE archive \cite{COMBINE2012}, and SBGN \cite{LeNovereHMMSS09} and model repositorities including BioModels and CellML Model Repository. These standards and repositories have enabled researchers to easily replicate in silico experiments using the same mathematical model, the same simulator, and the same parameter values. They have also enabled researchers to use models to conduct new experiments, to expand models, and to combine models into large, more comprehensive models.

Unfortunately, due to continued time pressures, emphasis on innovation, and the growing complexity of computational methods, the increased emphasis on replicability has not translated into increased reproducibility. This is exemplified by the recent \textit{Mycoplasma genitalium} whole-cell model \cite{Karr2012}. The authors took great strides to ensure that their software can replicate results, given the same initial conditions and random number generator seed. Unfortunately, the novelty and complexity of the model make it difficult for other researchers to reproduce the model or its scientific conclusions. 

Waltemath and Schreiber recently held a week-long workshop including 60 modelers, modeling software developers, and standards developers to reproduce the model using SBML and open-source modeling software. The workshop made great progress toward reproducing the model in SBML, including draft SBML versions of most of the submodels. However, because the model requires many new SBML languages features that are still only supported by a few simulation software programs and because the model is large, the over one-person year of effort that was devoted to the workshop was only a small fraction of the total effort that is needed to reproduce the model.

% When tests are performed directly on physical systems, the outcome can be subject to a
% number of contextual factors. In biological systems, experimental measurements are highly
% sensitive to context. It has b een suggested that such sensitivity may be due to selective
% pressure causing organisms to develop traits and behaviors that enable robustness under
% a variety of environmental conditions \cite{ArkinContext12}.
% cite Begley Nature drug discovery 2012?

% In computational modeling of biological systems, a simulation is carried out according
% to an initial state and a set of rules which govern the evolution of a model.
% Provided that the same initial state is used, the simulation results should be identical.
% Computational models would seem avoid reproducibility
% problems stemming from the complex interaction of context with observed behavior.

% However, scientific understanding depends on the ability to lucidly understand the
% underlying laws which govern the behavior of a system.
% % introduce rhetoric about predictive power / mathematical abstraction?
% While replicability is a useful feature, it does not promote understanding stemming
% from the underlying theory of the model.
% On the contrary, it can cause ingraining of idiosyncratic behavior peculiar to a specific
% implementation.

% Replicability is a stepping stone to reproducibility. At the very least, it provides a
% baseline reference to which future implementations can be compared. Indeed, in computer
% science fields, replicability of independent, repeated runs of software
% is a property of the design of the system, and can form a topic of study in its own right.

% In this report, we discuss the ideas of reproducibility and replicability and
% the role they play in the context of a whole-cell model of \textit{Mycoplasma genitalium}
% \cite{Karr2012},
% which represents the first integrated physics-based computational model of a complete organism.
Here, we outline the requirements for replicability, show how they can
be achieved in the implementation of simulation software, and discuss how this can benefit
reproducibility. We also show how these principles apply to the \textit{Mycoplasma genitalium} whole-cell
model \cite{Karr2012} and the specific deficiencies for reproduction.
Finally, we discuss how the biological modeling community can work toward standards
and tools which enable better reproducibility of complex models.

\end{figure*}

\section{Reproducibility in Computational Modeling}

Replicability is a precursor to reproducibility, and refers to the ability to
re-run a simulation (possibly on a different machine) to obtain identical results \cite{easterbrook2014open}.
Reproducibility is a stronger requirement and requires a replicable result as a basis for comparison.

In order for a model to meet our definition of reproducibility, it must satisfy certain criteria,
which are summarized in Fig. \ref{fig_repro_diagram}.
The theoretical formulation of the model must be well-understood.
Many mathematical modeling techniques have been applied to biology \cite{gombert2000mathematical}.
These techniques have been studied extensively and any new techniques will need to be subjected to
the same degree of scrutiny in order to form a viable foundation for reproducible models.
For example, the \textit{M. genitalium} model makes use of a Markov chain process in
transcriptional elongation. The Markov chain represents states of an RNA polymerase:
free, non-specifically bound to the chromosome, specifically bound to
the chromosome (i.e. bound at a locus such as a promoter), and actively transcribing.
The transition matrix for these states is a necessary detail for reproducibility.

Transparency is essential to achieving reproducibility for complex models.
Making source code publicly available is an important step in this direction \cite{easterbrook2014open}.
However, a systematic framework for transparency is necessary to the continued success of whole-cell modeling.
The ideal goal should be to create a machine-readable database containing information describing the experimental source for all data used in a model.
Semantic web technologies such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) can be useful in this capacity, and have been used to successfully express genetic components \cite{galdzicki2014synthetic} using linked data.

The numerical algorithms used by the simulator must converge on a solution.
For example, kinetic models define a set of differential equations.
Assuming boundary conditions are imposed to select a unique solution,
the numerical result converges to an exact solution which can be reproduced across different simulators.
% This is possible because the numerical solution of a differential equation
% converges on the true solution.
% The convergence of numerical methods has been well-studied for ordinary differential
% equations \cite{brenan1996numerical}, but convergence of hybrid methods is less well understood.

Any data which is used in the model (for example, initial/boundary conditions, parameters, and training data)
must be documented.
In the \textit{M. genitalium} model, much of this data came from the literature.
Over 900 papers and 1,900 experimentally observed parameters were used to construct the model \cite{Karr2012}.
Many of the parameters of the model were based on measurements made in other species \cite{macklin2014future}.
The sources for various types of experimental data must be preserved,
as well as the rationale behind using them in a particular setting
(e.g. the choice of parameter values).
Future advances may help to automate this process, this accelerating model development.

\subsection{Current Approaches}

There has been a large effort to address reproducibility in computational biology.
The state of reproducibility has improved considerably due to standards such as SED-ML \cite{sedml2011}.
However, despite these advances, reproducibility in computational biology remains a challenge \cite{garijo2013quantifying}.

Part of this difficulty can be attributed to gaps in standards.
SED-ML, for example, has good coverage of simulation parameters, but
does not address the limitations of the underlying simulator.
Other concerns, such as data transparency, play an important role that is becoming more apparent.
With the emergence of complex hybrid models, more researchers the increased demand for curated, high quality single-cell measurements as a driving force behind improving the current state-of-the-art for pathway and genome databases.

Another barrier to reproducibility concerns limited support for standards.
One advantage of representing a model in a standard format such as SBML is the ability
to utilize different simulators.
SBML Level 3 consists of extensions which enable additional
functionality, such as
hierarchical model composition \footnote{http://co.mbine.org/standards/sbml/level-3/version-1/comp/version-1/release-2},
flux balance constraints \footnote{ http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications/SBML\_Level\_3/Packages/fbc}, and
arrays \footnote{http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications/SBML\_Level\_3/Packages/arrays}.
While the features offered by these packages are critically important for certain
types of models, not all simulators support them.
As SBML gains highly specialized capabilities, it also becomes fractionated, as
not all researchers have a need for such special-purpose features.
If a model makes use of features outside the SBML Level 3 core specification,
there is a risk of being confined to a niche of the dynamical modeling community.
In this case, the advantage of utilizing SBML, as opposed to an \textit{ad hoc} representation
of the model, is diminished.

\section{Building Reproducible Models}



% \section{Technical definitions}
%
% \subsection{Replicability}

% We will use the term \textit{original record} for data which is output
% by a simulator
% (such as a record of the values of state variables of a model over a time-course simulation)
% for a specific experiment with specific initial data and parameters
% and which serves as the reference of comparison for future attempts
% to recapitulate the same experiment.
% For example, the data set used to generate a time-course plot in a publication
% is an original record.
% The external inputs to the software (in the form of data or user interaction)
% which may influence the results of the simulation are termed the \textit{original context}.
%
% The original context does not contain all information required to successfully replicate
% an experiment. For example, architectural differences in hardware could result in numeric
% differences in output. However, extensive standardization in computer technology, such as recent versions
% of the IEEE 754 standard for floating point arithmetic, helps to mitigate numerical discrepancies
% due to different machines. While IEEE 754 does not guarantee that an operation will produce
% a result which is exactly identical across implementations \cite{goldberg1991every}, compliance with the standard
% guarantees results to significant accuracy.
% Moreover, we will not relax the requirements of replicability, but instead view it as a
% golden norm to which all implementations should strive to achieve, with slight
% numerical discrepancies being the expectation.
% Reproducibility of arithmetic operations is not germane to the topic of this report and
% we will therefore ignore it for the remainder.
%
% % Goldberg: http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html
%
% \begin{definition}
% For a given arithmetic system,
% a record of a simulated experiment is a \textit{replica} of an original record if
% the values of the record agree with the original down to some numerical precision.
% \end{definition}
%
% % Precision is a property of the replica.
% % If precision is not specified, it is assumed to equal the maximum precision
% % of the arithmetic representation, i.e. to compare equal under that system.
%
% \begin{definition}
% An experiment is said to be \textit{replicable} if, given the original context,
% the output of the simulator is a replica of the original record.
% The \textit{range of replicability} is the set of environments (hardware and software)
% which can be used to generate a replica.
% \end{definition}
%
% The range of replicability for a given original record may encompass different
% machines, hardware, operating systems, and even different simulation software.
% The results of simple integer arithmetic on a pocket calculator are, for example,
% quite replicable across different calculators.

% \subsection{Reproducibility}
%
% Reproducibility, as used in this paper, refers to the underlying science
% behind a result.
% Is it possible, for example, to derive the results of a computer simulation
% from first principles?
% Reproducibility underscores the true connection to the system being studied, and defies a technical
% definition, as the results of two models may only be qualitatively similar, yet be
% capable of predicting the same phenomenon.
% The requirement of first principles is crucial, as two models may agree
% due to overfitting.
% Data-driven approaches, for example, do not fit in this category.
% Our a general preference in science for simpler models (out of a set of
% alternatives).
%
% The scientific progress in creating a computational model is not the
% software itself, but rather what it teaches us about the system under study.
% In attempting to reproduce an experiment, as opposed to replicating it,
% we construct a new implementation from first principles.
% Based on how the output of this implementation compares to the original,
% we can evaluate the usefulness of the principles behind the operation
% of the implementation.
% While this may sound trivial, large scientific software systems
% contain an immense level of detail and many assumptions are buried
% deep in their internals.
% Reproducibility helps shed light on these details, and draws attention
% to scientific knowledge which may have initially been overlooked.

\subsection{Replicability Requirements}

Replicability is a useful tool in studying reproducibility.
If the output of a simulator cannot be replicated, it becomes
difficult to make any objective statement about the accuracy of the
underlying model.

A computer program is a predefined sequence of instructions.
In simple applications, provided that a program starts in the same state and reads the same
data each time it is run, the output should be constant.
In practice, software may fail to meet this expectation.
This behavior can be caused by algorithmic design.

Strictly speaking, most modern computers are designed to be deterministic
when viewed from a holistic perspective.
% Even software such as the SPIN model checker \cite{holzmann2004spin}, which is designed to
% simulate non-determinism, runs on a deterministic host.
However, an individual program itself represents a subset of the computer,
and when viewed in isolation it may appear to exhibit non-deterministic behavior.

Whether or not such apparent non-determinism (hereafter, simply non-determinism)
is problematic depends on the application.
For example, exhaustive methods (such as database queries) do not rely on the order
in which elements are enumerated.
However, in greedy methods non-determinism can lead to different output, even
when the input is the same.
% Nevertheless, there has been an increasing tendency to deviate from determinism
% in modern software.

Therefore, in order to achieve replicability, it is necessary to ensure
algorithmic determinism given the initial state (seed values) for the random number generators used.

\subsection{Determinism and Replicability}

Non-determinism in most software comes from two sources:

\begin{itemize}
\item Concurrency and synchronization
\item Memory layout
\end{itemize}

Concurrency can be a result of threading, or it can arise from
asynchronous input/output callbacks. In both cases, as well as with memory layout,
the non-determinism
can be seen as the result
of program interaction with the operating system.
The essential motif in this case is an interaction of a subsystem
with a larger system in which it is embedded.
When the subsystem is studied in isolation, the influence of the larger
system becomes a perturbation which cannot be accounted for or controlled by
the subsystem. The apparent ``non-determinism'' in these cases
is due to failing to account for all state information.
This is an important theme (and challenge) in the context of whole-cell modeling,
as we will discuss later. % quantum density matrix analogy

While threading, asynchronous operations, and memory layout all contribute
to non-determinism of software,
concurrency due to threading has received considerable attention in the literature.
This is perhaps due to an increasing push to exploit multi-core CPUs,
and the fact that concurrency is seen as the culprit of ``Heisenbugs,''
(errors which manifest themselves non-deterministically)
although memory layout and asynchronicity also exhibit such problems.

Two systems that have been proposed to eliminate non-determinism in threading
are C{\small ORE}D{\small ET} \cite{bergan2010coredet} and D{\small THREADS} \cite{liu2011dthreads}.
C{\small ORE}D{\small ET} is a framework and library for compiling C/C++ programs
using the LLVM compiler framework such that the generated machine code operates deterministically.
D{\small THREADS} is a replacement for the standard UNIX Pthreads library.
Both of these systems operate by preventing the sharing of information between
threads during a parallel phase, and allowing sharing and synchronization
in a deterministic way in a serial phase.
This biphasic structure imposes an overhead on the operation of the threading
system, but these approaches nevertheless show performance comparable to native
threading in many benchmarked cases \cite{liu2011dthreads}, indicating that they show
practical promise.

Both C{\small ORE}D{\small ET} and D{\small THREADS} also
feature deterministic memory allocation. In the case of D{\small THREADS},
this is achieved through a specially implemented memory allocator,
whereas in C{\small ORE}D{\small ET} it is achieved through compiling the
memory allocator itself with the C{\small ORE}D{\small ET} framework.

\subsection{Replicability and Reproducibility of the Whole-Cell Model}

The \textit{M. genitalium} whole-cell model \cite{Karr2012} consists of
28 submodels.
Each submodel represents a physiological process of the cell
and each is based on a mathematical biological modeling technique
(e.g. ODEs, Boolean networks, and flux balance analysis).

The model cannot be encoded in current standards.
One reason for this is that no standards for hybrid modeling currently exist.
While the hierarchical model composition package in SBML Level 3 does allow
for the encoding of multiple submodels, the extension relies on the ability
to flatten the resulting composite model to a single larger model.
Thus, it is not possible to represent modules which run independently
and synchronize at regular timesteps, as is the case in the \textit{M. genitalium} whole-cell model.

The \textit{M. genitalium} model makes use of features outside of SBML Level 3 core,
such as rule-based and stoichiometric methods.
While this is not a barrier to encoding the model in SBML \textit{per se}, the lack
of a single simulator which supports all of the necessary extensions
prevents such a model from being simulated.

The integration of the submodels in \textit{M. genitalium} is not a process currently
addressed by standards. In order to be replicable, it must be done deterministically.
A simulation involves running each submodel independently. At each time step,
the submodels are synchronized and the shared variables are updated.
The whole-cell model coordinates this synchronization and partitions resources such as ATP
among the submodels.
This process is not unlike a multithreaded software system where each thread performs
a specific task. The serial execution of a program can be designed to be deterministic.
Likewise, the submodels of the whole-cell model are designed in such a way that
they are individually replicable. The seed for the pseudorandom number generator
used in the whole-cell model was recorded in order to allow replication of simulation results.

The integration of these disparate modeling techniques poses distinct challenges.
Much in the same way that multithreaded programming greatly complicates
determinism in software, integration of submodels complicates the behavior
of the whole-cell model.
Using systems like C{\small ORE}D{\small ET} and D{\small THREADS}, it is possible
to achieve deterministic behavior of a computer program which uses threads.
It is instructive to consider whether the same approach can be applied to whole-cell
modeling, and indeed the \textit{M. genitalium} whole-cell model already displays
some hallmarks of deterministic frameworks, such as the biphasic structure if its timestep.
This suggests that technologies such as C{\small ORE}D{\small ET} and D{\small THREADS}
can offer insights into how to integrate a hybrid model in a replicable way.

\subsection{Standardization Efforts}

% Standardization of the \textit{M. genitalium} whole-cell model \cite{Karr2012}
% was the topic of a workshop in Rostock, Germany from March 9-13, 2015.
% The workshop was organized by subdividing the participants into teams,
% each of which focused on one of the 28 submodels of the whole-cell model
% \hl{[Waltemath(same issue)?]}.
%
% Recalling that (in this paper) reproducibility refers to the ability to
% reimplement a model and still recover the same predictions.
% Recreating exact numerical replicas is not a requirement for this definition
% of reproducibility.
%
% An additional goal of the workshop was to assess and improve the current
% condition of standards within the biological modeling community.
% This in fact became the dominant consideration in many of the teams,
% including the transcription team, which one of us (J.K. Medley)
% was a member of.

SBML is the de facto standard for encoding biological models \cite{hucka2003systems},
and encoding the processes represented in the \textit{M. genitalium}
submodels represented a major area of focus.
The main difficulty in arriving at a satisfactory SBML representation
of the transcription submodel is due to the use of a Markov chain
process for modeling transcriptional elongation.
In the whole-cell model, an RNA polymerase may be in one of four states:
free, non-specifically bound to the chromosome, specifically bound to
the chromosome (i.e. bound at a locus such as a promoter), and actively transcribing.
Transitions between these states are governed by various factors
(transitioning from bound to active, for example, requires a sigma factor).

SBML models the occupancy of discrete states, and while the RNA polymerase states
are discrete and enumerable, the various states of transcript elongation
represent an explosion of states. Each gene of length $n$ admits $n$ states
at different stages of elongation.
This sheer number of states, one for each \textit{M. genitalium's}
580,076 base pairs, overwhelms most SBML
simulators.
Furthermore, an even greater number of states would be required to model additional physiological processes during transcription,
such as the early binding of ribosomes before the transcript is released
by the polymerase (a detail which is not currently incorporated into the
\textit{M. genitalium} model).
For this reason, discrete elongation states are not a scalable solution.
There may be hope for rule-based modeling of such systems using the SBML
multi package \footnote{http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications/SBML\_Level\_3/Packages/multi}, but the essential focus here is not the current limitations
of standards, but rather on methods enabling robust reproduction of results,
with the view that standards will follow practice.

The Markov chain describing the transcription process can, for example,
be readily simulated using Gillespie's algorithm \cite{gillespie1977exact}
with rate laws representing relative state transition probabilities.
The limitations of state space size notwithstanding, this approach renders
the transcriptional process amenable to reproduction within SBML.

\section{Conclusion}
Biology involves the study of complex systems.
In order to form useful models, it is necessary to use approximations.
These approximations are representative of the underlying physical
system at various degrees of granularity in terms of time and space.
The accuracy of models derived from such approximations may be influenced
by lack of pertinent data, computational limitations, or lack of
understanding of the modeled system.

In the modeling community, we must recognize that the assumptions which
are used in a complex model (such as the \textit{M. genitalium} whole-cell model)
form a scientific inquiry: The assumptions used in the model are
essentially a hypothesis, and the test of this hypothesis is whether
these assumptions capture all relevant dynamical information
at the time and space scale of the simulation.
This can be answered by testing the model's predictions against other
models and also against non-training data.

Ultimately, transparency, numerical robustness, and documentation all influence the reproducibility
of a model. Large, complex models such as the \textit{M. genitalium} whole-cell model
help emphasize these needs.
Other fields have also encountered these issues in different context and have
responded by building standards and tools to satisfy these needs.
Due to the complexity of biological systems, the field of computational biology
may well need to push beyond the solutions devised in the past.
In this report, we have highlighted several areas where reproducibility may be improved.
Technological breakthroughs in these areas will enable more rapid progress in whole-cell modeling.
