Objective: To outline the requirements for reproducible dynamical models in systems biology. Methods: We describe the standards and software tools that are needed to enable researchers to reproduce models and simulations. Results: We show that it is possible to engineer models and software tools for better reproducibility by using deterministic algorithms, data integration, and explicit documentation of assumptions. Conclusion: While dynamical modeling has made great strides with the creation of the first whole-cell model of Mycoplasma genitalium, continuing to advance dynamical modeling requires reproducing increasingly complex models and simulations. Building an ecosystem of software and standards which emphasize reproducibility is a necessary step in achieving this goal. Significance: It is currently challenging to reproduce complex simulations. Here, we suggest how future tools and standards might be tailored to meet upcoming challenges in reproducible modeling. We use whole-cell modeling as an example throughout our discussion.
